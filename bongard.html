          Bongard problems are a type of abstract logic puzzle that I belive
          have some intersting properties in the context of knowledge
          representation. In this document I explain what Bongard problems are
          and why I think they are interesting.

          This is a Bongard problem. There are six things on the left side and
          six things on the right side. The person who created the problem drew
          that distinction for a reason. The question is: why?
          <br><br>
          An answer to this problem is that the things on the left are made of
          lines and curves, while the things on the right are made of squiggles.
          <br><br>
          Let's look at another example.
          <br><br>

          <br><br>
          Here we see a bunch of puzzle pieces. A solution to this problem is
          that the puzzle pieces on the left hand side can be fit together to
          make a complete puzzle, while the pieces on the right can't.

          <h3>Interesting properties of Bongard problems</h3>

          <h4>A picture is worth a thousand words</h4>
          ... and a Bongard problem is worth twelve-thousand. Bongard problems
          let us describe easily what we mean by certain words. Here's an
          exercise: come up with a definition for what the word "triangle" means
          (in the context of geometry).
          <br><br>
          I bet your definition was something along the lines of "a triangle is
          a shape composed of three line segments joined at three corners". Such
          a definition is just about as good as we can do using just a few
          pieces of text. But I think that there's a lot of stuff we would
          consider triangular that wouldn't exactly fit that definition. Take
          this Bongard problem, for instance:

          <br><br>

          <img style="max-width: 100%" src="https://www.foundalis.com/res/bps/bongard/p097.gif">
          <br><br>

          This problem indicates the difference between triangles and circles.
          Of the triangles on the left hand side, I think only the top-left and
          maybe the top-right are well-described by our textual definition of a
          triangle. Most of the triangles aren't composed of what we would
          normally describe as "line segments". Moreover, almost none of them
          are composed of three things at all! One is made of nineteen circles.
          Another is made of sixteen line segments.

          <br><br>

          I think we'd have to use a lot more words to come up with a definition
          of "triangle" that did a satisfying job of indicating everything we
          mean by that word.

          <br><br>

          What I'm getting at here is that, with enough effort, you can describe
          just about any idea using Bongard problems. Here's a more complex
          problem that I'll leave you to solve. Hover over it with your mouse to
          see an answer if you need to.

          <h4>One right answer, multiple equivalent formulations</h4>

          Most things in life don't have one "right" interpretation---it'd be
          foolish to assume so; it's not uncommon for people to spend inordinate
          ammounts of time discussing their different interpretations of the
          meaning of a movie, article, work of art, book, or any other thing we
          can interact with.

          <br><br>

          But Bongard problems seem somewhat different. In a properly crafted
          problem there always seems only one right answer. There will be, of
          course, multiple ways of formulating the answer---but all those ways
          will point at the same thing. We could say, for instance, that the
          triangle | circle distinction was actually a shape with three sides |
          shape with one smooth curve distinction. But we'd really be talking
          about the same underlying idea.

          <br><br>

          To test this theory, try forming an incompatible interpretation of the
          triangle | circle problem. The only rule I can come up with is "the
          things on the left are positioned to the left of the things on the
          right". This is quite an unsatisfying rule; every single Bongard
          problem follows it. The rule doesn't do a good job of describing what
          makes this problem special.

          <h3>Conjunction</h3>

          Both of the interesting qualities I've outlined---representing complex
          ideas and only having one right answer---are not special by
          themselves. Indeed, we can easily represent complex ideas using text,
          videos, pictures, and more. There also exist other things that only
          have one right answer: crossword puzzles, for instance, usually only
          have one solution.

          <br><br>

          I think, though, you'd be hard-pressed to find a medium that shares
          both of these qualities succinctly. We could---and do---create text
          that accurately describes what we're talking about. But doing so is an
          extremely tedious and time-intensive process. Creating Bongard
          problems, on the other hand, is much easier.
