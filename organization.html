          A major use of computers is to store and organize representations of
          knowledge. Indeed, this very page is a textual representation of
          knowledge concerning the topic of organization itself. In this
          document, I will look at various forms through which we can represent
          and organize knowledge in computers and point out their strengths and
          weaknesses.

          <h3>Language</h3>
          Language is an incredibly useful medium for expressing ideas. Its
          usefulness comes from its generality; one would be hard-pressed to
          find an idea that is completely unrepresentable with words.
          <br><br>
          A common way of representing language in a computer is as text, though
          it is also possible to represent language as speech in audio or video
          snippets.
          <br><br>
          Language is less useful when we want to use our computer to understand
          its meaning. We would never think to ask, for instance, "please
          computer, explain what this passage in my textbook means in greater
          detail". That's something only a human being with the right
          understanding could do. A computer sees only a sequence of
          characters---not the ideas they represent. Expecting it to understand
          what we mean by those characters is unfair.
          <br><br>
          A useful distinction to draw here is between structured and <a class="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data">unstructured data</a>.

          <pre>Unstructured data (or unstructured information) is information that
either does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organized
in a pre-defined manner. Unstructured information is typically
text-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts
as well. This results in irregularities and ambiguities that make
it difficult to understand using traditional programs as compared
to data stored in fielded form in databases or annotated
(semantically tagged) in documents.

-- Wikipedia page on unstructured data</pre>

          Text is very much unstructured. That lack of structure is what makes
          it difficult for computers to understand its meaning.
          <br><br>
          A separate problem with language is that it is not knowledge itself,
          but rather an indication of knowledge. The words we use are mostly
          arbitrary. We could all agree at this moment to use the word
          "airplane" to indicate what we mean by "green", and go about our day
          pointing out the "airplane"-colored car, or the environmental
          bennefits of using "airplane" energy over fossil fuels.

          <br><br>
          A silly example, though its implication is important: we can't be
          certain that those interpreting the text we write are interpreting it
          in the same way we meant it to be interpreted. All forms of
          representing knowledge suffer this burden, though language especially
          so.
          <br><br>
          To summarize, language is good because we can express just about
          anything using it. It is bad because we can't be certain that people
          will interpret our language in the way we intend them to, and because
          it's hard for computers to understand the meaning of our language.

          <h3>The file system</h3>

          We depart from unstructured data to talk about a well-understood kind
          of structured data: hierarchical directories. Every computer has one.
          It's where your text documents, photos, program data, and programs
          themselves are stored.
          <br><br>
          A system of organizing information, like a file system, is nothing
          without anything to organize. In this case, we organize files. If a
          file contains text, then the strengths and weakness of text that were
          outlined in the previous section "bubble up" to affect the file system
          itself.
          <br><br>
          One advantage of the file system is that we can ask it questions like
          "explain what 'birthday-pictures' means". We'd ask this question by
          clicking on a folder called "birthday-pictures". The computer would
          respond with the contents of that folder which---assuming we've been
          thoroughly organizing our files---would contain pictures relating to
          birthdays. This stands in stark contrast from pure text, in which
          there were essentially no questions we could ask our computer about
          its meaning.
          <br><br>
          File systems are not without their limitations. Anyone who has used a
          file system for long enough eventually runs into the problem of trying
          to put a file into two folders at once. Let's say, for example, I've
          got a picture of me on my birthday on the beach. I've visited and
          taken photos at beaches before, so I've already got a file named
          "beach-pictures". I've also taken photos on my birthday previously, so
          I have a "birthday-pictures" folder as well. This is the first time
          that I've had a birthday on the beach. The question is: what folder do
          I put my new photos in?
          <br><br>
          The most complete answer to the problem of wanting to put a file into two
          folders at once is to use <a class="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link">hard links</a> to, well, actually
          put a file in multiple folders at once. Unfortunately, maintaining
          such a system requires a lot of hard work. The programs we have today
          don't expect people to be hard-linking files everywhere all the time,
          so they aren't built with features that help you do such organization.

          <h3>Tag based systems</h3>

          In light of the difficulties we face when trying to organize
          information in a file system, it's logical to opt for a system whose
          structure is more free-flowing. In a tagging system we use categories
          instead of folders, the main difference being that an object (file) can be in more
          than one category (folder) at once.
          <br><br>
          It's possible to emulate a tag-based system in a directory based
          system using links---that's quite cumbersome though, as I've alluded
          to earlier. It's also possible to emulate a directory system in a tag
          based system by tagging objects with their file paths. For example, I
          can tag a picture of me on my birthday with the text
          "file-path:birthday-pictures/picture12.png". People have constructed
          tag-based systems that do this very thing.
          <br><br>
          A problem that we eventually run into when using tag-based systems is
          that it's difficult to talk about the tags themselves inside of the
          system.
          <br><br>
          For example, let's say that I've got the tags "orange", "purple",
          "sunset", and "cake" placed upon one of my birthday images. In the
          picture, we see a cake with purple frosting in front of an orange
          sunset. Note: we lost information in our tags. The tags don't tell us
          the color of the cake or the sunset---they only tell us that there is
          a cake and sunset. We can remedy this situation by adding new tags
          into the system: "orange-sunset" and "pruple-frosted-cake". But now
          it's harder to talk about the idea of orangeness or purpleness; any
          query for "purple" or "orange" I make must be followed up with a query
          for "orange-sunset" or "purple-frosted-cake" respectively.
          <br><br>
          One way to solve this is to add a rule to the system that the tag
          "orange-sunset" implies the tag "orange", so any queries for "orange"
          should automatically display "orange-sunset". The issue of juggling so
          many seemingly redundant tags still remains, however.

          <h3>Hypertext</h3>

          Hypertext---the medium that the web is crafted out of---enables us to
          easily link different documents together; what was once a textual
          citation in a paper book can become an actual link in a web document.
          <br><br>
          Such linkage allows us to easily connect related pieces of information
          together in ways that are difficult in tag based and directory based
          systems.
          <br><br>
          One issue is that links are one-way in the web. For example, let's say
          that I'm reading a blog post about puppies. On the blog, I see a link
          to a Wikipedia article about puppies, so I click it. I'm now on the
          Wikipedia page. Since the Wikipedia page doesn't include any links
          back to the blog post, the only way to get back is to hit the "back"
          button in my web browser.
          <br><Br>
          This becomes a problem when I'm reading the Wikipedia page and wonder:
          "what other websites talk about puppies?". It'd be nice if there was
          some way to see a list of such pages on Wikipedia itself. Of course,
          there is no such list. I end up having to use a search engine to
          manually perform the query for me, with varrying results.
          <br><br>
          A separate issue with the web relates to change. A link is an
          indication of the ideas represented in the document addressed by the
          link. But that document can change, and the indicated ideas will
          change along with it. If I link to a blog post, saying that it's a
          "good description of how to adopt a puppy", I can't be sure that the
          document at that link will always be such a thing. The post could, in
          the future, morph into discussing dogs as a whole, or include kittens,
          or change in any other imaginable way. The worst case is that the
          document vanishes, resulting in the dreaded "404 page not found"
          error.
          <br><br>
          One way to fix this is to create a local copy of the web page and link
          to that instead. I can be relatively certain that the copy won't
          change---I've got no motive to change it---unfortunately, I've just
          broken the link from my website to theirs. Now I'm pointing at a local
          copy, and the copy is not the thing itself. The link between my
          website and theirs is now much weaker.
