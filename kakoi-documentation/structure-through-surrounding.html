<h1 id="impose-structure-by-surrounding-alike-things">impose structure by surrounding alike things</h1>
<p><a href="kakoi.html">kakoi</a> allows the grouping of alike things. A single interpretation of a piece of data may be placed in any number of—possibly overlapping—groups. Groups themselves are treated as pieces of information that can be placed in further groups.</p>

<p>By default, <a href="kakoi.html">kakoi</a> imposes no rules on what may be placed within a group. If several things appear to share a certain quality, group them!</p>
