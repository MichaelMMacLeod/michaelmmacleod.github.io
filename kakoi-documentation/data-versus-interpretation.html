<h1 id="kakoi---design-goal-appreciate-the-distinction-between-data-and-its-interpretation">kakoi - design goal: appreciate the distinction between data and its interpretation</h1>
<p><a href="kakoi.html">kakoi</a> separates the interpretation of data from the data itself. This may be implemented by storing exactly two different types of data: binary blobs, and functions <code>BinaryBlob -&gt; Interpretation</code>. Users of the system may associate (encircle) a function and a binary blob. By doing so, <a href="kakoi.html">kakoi</a> will use the interpretation of the data given by the function.</p>
<p>There should be several built-in interpretations available including utf-8 text, png images, and video files.</p>
