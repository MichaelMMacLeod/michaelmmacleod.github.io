<h2 id="display-groups-as-nested-circles">display groups as nested circles</h2>
<p><a href="kakoi.html">kakoi</a> presents a group visually as a set of circles. Each of these circles may be a group itself (in which it would contain further circles) or a fundamental interpretation of data, like an image, piece of text, or video. The circles must be zoomable, to allow for deeply-nested groups to be examined.</p>
<h2 id="preserve-the-meaning-of-existing-groups">preserve the meaning of existing groups</h2>
<p>The purpose behind grouping certain pieces of information is likely to differ among individuals. <a href="kakoi.html">kakoi</a> ensures that—once a group is formed—it cannot be changed: no new information can be added to it, removed from it, or changed inside of it.</p>
<h2 id="build-upon-existing-groups-efficiently">build upon existing groups efficiently</h2>
<p><a href="kakoi.html">kakoi</a> must allow the creation of a group that is like a different group, except changed in some way—perhaps by the addition or removal of a piece of information. The process of creating new groups must simple and efficient.</p>
<h2 id="enable-the-creation-of-recursive-groups">enable the creation of recursive groups</h2>
<p>Some concepts seem necessarily circular. For instance, the idea of naming a concept can itself be named (by “naming”). For this reason, it must be possible to create a group that references itself.</p>

<h2 id="enable-introspection-of-fundamental-data-types">enable introspection of fundamental data types</h2>
<p><a href="kakoi.html">kakoi</a> must be able to traverse the structure of the data it stores. This is necessary to, for instance, <a href="#support-queries">support queries</a> of arbitrary types of data (not just text).</p>
<h2 id="enable-the-creation-of-new-fundamental-data-types">enable the creation of new fundamental data types</h2>
<p><a href="kakoi.html">kakoi</a> should be extendable, allowing users to use a programming language to define new ways of interpreting data. These interpretations must be able to control the way they are presented and interacted with.</p>
