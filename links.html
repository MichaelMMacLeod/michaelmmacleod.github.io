            A vision of the web that has bidirectional links, as well as some
            other interesting properties.
            <li><a class="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</a></li>
            A book that mentions---among other interesting things---Bongard
            problems.

            A paper in which the authors describe a tag-based replacement for
            the conventional file system.
            <li><a class="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics">Semiotics</a></li>
            This is the field of study concerning with the distinction between
            representation and meaning.
            <li><a class="inline-link" href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Radical_Constructivism.html?id=C6I9AAAAIAAJ">Radical Constructivism: A Way of Knowing and Learning</a></li>
            A book explaining a theory of how we come to know things. I have
            found this quite useful when thinking about knowledge representation
            in computers.
            <li><a class="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_Form">Laws of Form</a></li>
            Takes the idea of distinction and uses it to create a complete
            mathematical system. The interesting part of this book, for
            me, lies in the first few pages which describe the axioms of the
            system. I recommend thinking about Bongard problems while you read.
            <li><a class="inline-link" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/">Arrival (2016 movie)</a></li>
            Kakoi's visuals were inspired in part by the alien language. Also,
            if you liked the movie, you really aught to read the book it's based
            on. The movie takes, in my oppinion, certain wrong interpretations
            of the source material that lead it away from hard science fiction
            and towards fantasy.

            A paper that describes an extremely customizable programming language.
            <li><a class="inline-link" href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/">IPFS: the InterPlanetary File System</a></li>
            A decentralized file system in which the information pointed to by a
            link does not change.
            <li><a class="inline-link" href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?Kakoi">Kakoi definition</a></li>
            Kakoi is a word used when playing the board game Go to describe a
            move that acts to surround an area. I named the project Kakoi
            because the main action taken in the system is to surround alike
            things.

            A paper that investigates what is necessary for learning
            mathematical topics.
            <li><a class="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a></li>
            A "knowledge management and note-taking" system. A major inspiration
            for Kakoi.
            <li><a class="inline-link" href="https://www.orgroam.com/">Org-roam</a></li>
            Zettelkasten, but for Emacs' org-mode. What's not to like?
